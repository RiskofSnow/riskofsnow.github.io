        Really, who am I? 
        <br><br>
        I am a poet, a coder, a gamer, and many other things! 
        I'm well-versed in Java, HTML, PostGreSQL, Spring Boot, and know my way around CSS, Javascript,
        and a few other languages.
        <br>
        I started coding in middle school during my 8th grade year after taking a summer camp about creating your own website. The site is sadly long gone,
        but I've done my best to recreate it's glory here in a more professional manner.
        <br>
        From there, I joined my school's Robotics Club and began tinkering with both the hardware and software that made our robot run.
        Learning from my family and fellow coders, I was able to quickly learn more about the software development process, and have since 
        built my own modifications to my favorite games, created programs to assist in daily life, and others to prove and improve my skills!
